# task.it Mobile App

This is a Flutter mobile app for the task.it platform. It allows users to modify their projects on the task.it platform easily on the go. Data is served to the task.it mobile app from the same [Flask backend](https://github.com/saarthak2002/taskit-backend) that is used by the [task.it web application](https://github.com/saarthak2002/taskit-app), ensuring that user data is always synced across different platforms.
